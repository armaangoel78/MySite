                A volunteer management and hour tracking system developed for Exodus Refugee Immigration Inc. This organization expressed that their current paper-and-pencil system for tracking volunteers is very labor intensive, requiring a staff member to pend hours a week crunching the numbers. Our solution not only makes it easier for volunteers to find potentinal opportunities, it also allows organizations to track the hours performed by each volunteer.

                The site is currently in Beta mode, meaning it is only used by Exodus, but it will soon be available for any organization to use with only a minimal hosting and domain charge.
